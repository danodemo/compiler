# compiler
A quick code generator for Showcase hotsheets

This will generate a shortcode to be used for Showcase IDX's Divi solution.

Simply open a command line (that is able to run Ruby programs) and navigate to the download folder of Compiler.

Enter the following command to activate Compiler:
`ruby compiler.rb`

Then simply follow the instructions in the command line to get the resultant code!

# notes
- City name MUST be capitalized
- Street address may need to be tweaked for different listings: "1010 Scott Street" may become "1010 Scott St" in the system,
so make sure to check if there are missing listings
- Name can be anything

# todo
- Add options for additional fields (bathrooms, bedrooms, property type)
- Turn it into an applet instead of a command line tool
- Add soundtrack and graphics
